# Pandemic Panic

Service to keep you updated with information from trusted sources when the world goes to s**t.

## FAQ

- Why?

	COVID-19.

- Isn't this the same as news?

	Yes and No. This will be limited to movie apocalypse size incidents. In these partisan, people at times don't believe a particular news channel because of what political side they lean towards. I wish for this to be neutral and purely fact based.
